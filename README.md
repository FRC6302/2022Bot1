# 2022Bot1
FRC Team 6302's robot code for the 2022 Rapid React season

Most important/coolest files:
1. RobotState.java
2. TrackTargetTurret.java


This project has the framework and correct math for shooting while moving, but I never got around to making everything perfect enough for it to actually work. For it to work, I would need to:
1. make the turret feedforward and tracking more accurate
2. same for the shooter, need to be able to change shooting speed quickly and accurately
3. be able to score consistently from any distance while not moving (our biggest problem lol)
4. upgrade the pose estimator kalman filter to the better version
5. figure how to get more consistent limelight data
